# Comprehensive Security Analysis: Auth Demo APIs

## Authentication & Authorization

### Token-Based Authentication
- **Implementation**: Custom token authorizer function validates all API requests
- **Token Storage**: API tokens stored securely in AWS Parameter Store with encryption
- **Token Validation**: Each request's Authorization header is verified against stored token
- **Cache Mechanism**: Tokens cached for 5 minutes to reduce Parameter Store API calls
- **Policy Generation**: Creates temporary IAM policies permitting or denying specific API actions

### API Access Control
- **Bearer Token Requirement**: All API requests must include "Bearer {token}" in Authorization header
- **Per-Environment Tokens**: Separate tokens for development, testing, and production environments
- **Fine-Grained Access Control**: Token validation generates specific IAM policies limited to particular methods
- **Request Validation**: Authorizer rejects malformed or missing tokens with HTTP 401 responses

## Network Security

### VPC Architecture
- **Isolated Network**: All resources contained within dedicated Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
- **Network Segmentation**: Multiple subnet tiers with different security controls:
  - Public subnet: Only contains session manager host with restricted access
  - Private Lambda subnets: Contains Lambda functions with outbound internet access via NAT Gateway
  - Private database subnets: Contains Aurora PostgreSQL with no direct internet access

### Security Groups
- **Lambda Security Group**:
  - Allows outbound traffic to internet (through NAT)
  - Allows outbound traffic to database
  - No inbound traffic except from API Gateway
  
- **Database Security Group**:
  - Allows inbound PostgreSQL connections (port 5432) only from Lambda functions
  - Allows inbound connections from session manager host for administration
  - No outbound internet access
  
- **Session Manager Security Group**:
  - Allows inbound SSH (port 22) only from specified IP addresses
  - Whitelist-based approach for administrator access
  - Provides controlled entry point for database administration

### Data Transit Security
- **API Gateway to Lambda**: TLS 1.2+ encrypted connections
- **Lambda to Database**: Traffic never leaves AWS network and is encrypted
- **Client to API**: HTTPS with TLS 1.2+ enforced by CloudFront and API Gateway
- **Admin Access**: Session Manager tunneling through session manager host with key-based authentication

## Database Security

### Access Control
- **Credential Management**: Database username/password stored in AWS Secrets Manager
- **Dynamic Credential Retrieval**: Lambda functions retrieve credentials at runtime
- **Network Isolation**: Database in private subnets with no public IP address
- **Access Limitation**: Only accessible from Lambda functions and session manager host

### Encryption
- **Data at Rest**: Aurora storage encrypted with AWS KMS
- **Data in Transit**: TLS encryption between all components and database
- **Secrets**: Database credentials encrypted in Secrets Manager with KMS

## Deployment Security

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Least Privilege**: Each component has minimal required permissions
- **Split Stack Approach**: Separation of concerns between infrastructure, function code, and access control
- **Clean Dependencies**: Avoids circular dependencies and promotes clear security boundaries
- **Explicit Exports**: Infrastructure values shared via CloudFormation exports, not hard-coded

### IAM Security
- **Function-Specific Roles**: Each Lambda function has its own IAM role with minimal permissions
- **Scoped Database Access**: Functions can only access specific database resources
- **Controlled Secret Access**: Only authorized functions can access Secrets Manager values
- **Limited API Permissions**: Each function limited to specific API Gateway resources

## Threat Mitigation

### Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection
- **CloudFront Edge Protection**: Distributes and absorbs traffic spikes
- **API Gateway Throttling**: Configurable rate limiting prevents API abuse
- **AWS Shield**: Basic DDoS protection included with CloudFront and API Gateway

### Monitoring & Logging
- **Lambda Function Logs**: All authorization attempts logged to CloudWatch
- **API Gateway Access Logs**: Records of all API requests
- **Audit Trail**: Database actions tracked in dedicated audit log table
- **Authentication Failures**: Logged with detailed context for security analysis

### Secure Coding Practices
- **Input Validation**: All API inputs validated before processing
- **Error Handling**: Security-sensitive error details not exposed to clients
- **Authorization Checks**: Multiple verification points in request processing
- **Dependency Security**: Regular updates of dependencies for security patches

## Administrative Security

### Session Manager Host Architecture
- **Jump Server Design**: Administrators must first access session manager host
- **Key-Based Authentication**: SSH access requires private key
- **IP Restrictions**: SSH access limited to specific IP addresses
- **Database Tunneling**: Secure port forwarding for database access
- **Automatic Environment Setup**: Scripts handle secure credential retrieval and connection setup
- **MFA for Administrative Access**: Add multi-factor authentication for session manager host access

### Secrets Rotation
- **Parameter Store Values**: Structured for easy rotation
- **Secrets Manager**: Supports automatic credential rotation
- **No Hardcoded Credentials**: All sensitive values retrieved at runtime

## Multi-Environment Security

### Environment Isolation
- **Separate Deployments**: Distinct resources for dev, test, and production
- **Environment-Specific Credentials**: Different tokens and database credentials per environment
- **Cross-Environment Protection**: Production resources inaccessible from development or testing environments
- **Consistent Security Model**: Same security architecture applied across all environments

## Future Security Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Enhanced Logging**: Implement centralized security monitoring
- **Automated Security Testing**: Integrate security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- **AWS WAF Integration**: Add web application firewall for advanced request filtering
- **Certificate-Based Authentication**: Implement mutual TLS for service-to-service communication

The Auth Demo API security architecture follows AWS Well-Architected security best practices, implementing defense-in-depth with multiple security layers, zero-trust networking principles, and least-privilege access controls.
